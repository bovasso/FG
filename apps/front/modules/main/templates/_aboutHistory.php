    <p class="founded">Funny Garbage was founded at the dawn of the consumer internet era as a firm of like-minded creative individuals excited about the possibilities of harnessing new technologies to serve clients, create great content and have fun in the process.</p>
    <p>Founders John Carlin and Peter Gerardi were intrigued by the new medium and the ability to pioneer techniques for creating content and telling stories.  After rolling the first corporate purchase (an Apple Macintosh LCIII) to their first office on Spring Street in SOHO, John and Peter began developing online campaigns for clients such as Nike and Compaq Computer.  An assignment to develop Cartoon Network's first website was a dream job for the firm, providing an opportunity to combine a love of cartoons, animation and creation of a new online channel for the Turner network's content.</p>
    <p>As adoption of the internet by companies looking to reach consumers directly grew, we grew right along with it.  Work created for Comedy Central, VH1, AMC, IFC and Nickelodeon highlighted our growing creative and technology skills as well as the methodology we developed to provide clients with a clear and predictable project path.</p>
    <p>From our start, we have been focused on balancing our corporate work with projects for cultural institutions and non-profit organizations. Award winning work with clients such as the Smithsonian Institution, The Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History, the Whitney Museum for American Art, the New York Alliance for the Arts and PBS highlight our commitment and expertise.</p>
    <p>The most important aspect of the firm, unchanged since its founding, is our work environment.  We have created a great environment where people stay, collaborate with each other and grow as the industry and medium grows.  Today Funny Garbage is a firm of over 35 professionals located in New York City, focused on developing creative solutions to clients' business opportunities and issues.</p>
